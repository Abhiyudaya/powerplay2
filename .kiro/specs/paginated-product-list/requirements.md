# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a paginated product list application for Android using modern Android development practices. The app will display a list of products fetched from a REST API with pagination support, allowing users to browse products and view detailed information. The implementation will use RecyclerView for efficient list display, Retrofit for networking, and follow MVVM architecture patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of products so that I can browse available items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a RecyclerView with product items
2. WHEN products are loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading spinner
3. WHEN products load successfully THEN the system SHALL display each product with title, description, category, price, and image
4. IF no products are returned THEN the system SHALL display a "No Data" message
5. WHEN the user scrolls to the bottom THEN the system SHALL automatically load more products

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle pagination automatically so that I can seamlessly browse through all available products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL fetch the first page (page=0) with limit=10
2. WHEN the user scrolls near the bottom THEN the system SHALL fetch the next page using the nextPage value from API response
3. WHEN loading additional pages THEN the system SHALL append new products to the existing list
4. WHEN there are no more pages THEN the system SHALL stop attempting to load more data
5. WHEN pagination is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator at the bottom of the list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a product so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap on a product item THEN the system SHALL navigate to a product detail screen
2. WHEN the detail screen loads THEN the system SHALL display all product information including title, description, category, price, and image
3. WHEN I press the back button THEN the system SHALL return to the product list maintaining scroll position
4. WHEN the detail screen loads THEN the system SHALL show a loading state while fetching additional details if needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle network errors gracefully so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there is no internet connection THEN the system SHALL display an error screen with retry option
2. WHEN the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
3. WHEN I tap the retry button THEN the system SHALL attempt to reload the data
4. WHEN network errors occur during pagination THEN the system SHALL show an error message without clearing existing data
5. WHEN the retry is successful THEN the system SHALL hide the error message and display the data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to follow clean architecture principles so that the app is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing networking THEN the system SHALL use Retrofit with proper error handling
2. WHEN parsing JSON THEN the system SHALL use data classes with proper serialization
3. WHEN managing UI state THEN the system SHALL implement MVVM architecture with ViewModels
4. WHEN loading images THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading with caching (Glide or similar)
5. WHEN separating concerns THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern for data management

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth performance when scrolling through the product list so that I have a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through products THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
2. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show placeholder images to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN the same images are requested again THEN the system SHALL load them from cache
4. WHEN memory is low THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage image memory usage
5. WHEN the list is large THEN the system SHALL only keep visible items in memory (RecyclerView optimization)
